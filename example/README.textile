h1. Rack-I18n

This example rails app includes the rack-i18n app as middleware to set the I18n.locale

h2. Installation

@gem install bundler@
@bundle install@
@rake db:migrate@

h2. Testing 

unfortunately no tests exists at the moment.
For the rails app i should write some cucumber features and for the middleware i should learn how to test rack apps.
